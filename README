    Regexp::EN::NumVerbage - Regex pattern to match English number verbage
    in text

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::EN::NumVerbage ($RE);

     say $1 if "this year's revenue reaches 2.5 million dolars" =~ /\b($RE)\b/; # "2.5 million"

EXPORTS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $RE (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting verbage from text; it looks for
    a string of words. It's not perfect (the extracted verbage might not be
    valid, e.g. "thousand three"), but it's convenient.

SEE ALSO
    Regexp::ID::NumVerbage.
